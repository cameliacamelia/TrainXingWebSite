        <p class="lead">Train Level Crossing Solution</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Most crossings in Europe and around the world are marked by some form of saltire (Saint Andrews Cross) to warn road users about a level crossing and/or about a level crossing with no barriers whatsoever. This cross is on a level crossing in Slovenia.
            <br><br>
            Trains have a much larger mass relative to their braking capability, and thus a far longer braking distance than road vehicles. With rare exceptions, trains do not stop at level crossings and rely on vehicles and pedestrians to clear the tracks in advance.
            <br>
            Level crossings constitute a significant safety concern internationally. On average, each year around 400 people in the European Union[3] and over 300 in the United States[4] are killed in level crossing accidents. Collisions can occur with vehicles as well as pedestrians; pedestrian collisions are more likely to result in a fatality.[5] Among pedestrians, young people (5â€“19 years), older people (60 years and over) and males are considered to be high risk users.[6]

            In Romania:
            <ul>
                <li>3500 accidents/year</li>
                <li>45 deaths</li>
                <li>CFR  would pay ~100.000 $ to buy barriers</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
